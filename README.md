# üöó Red Stripe Customs


### Welcome to **Red Stripe Customs** -- a mockup website for a small, family-run-mechanic shop that also sells fixer-upper cars for cash.
This is a small portfolio/demo project I'm making to propose my services to a shop near me with. I want to collaborate with local businesses to create
their online presences since there aren't many other tech jobs near me. I'm also just doing this out of love for my craft and an appreciation for the straightforwardness and hard work of an auto business run by three great people who know their way around an engine bay.

### üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Clear, informative landing page
- Listings for cars currently being worked on
- Service offerings with a local flavor
- Contact section for quotes and walk-ins
- Emphasis on cash-only simplicity
